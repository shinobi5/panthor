<hr />

Initially this project will act as a playground for a repo of web platform and framework agnostic UI components and utilities. The intention isn't for this to turn into anything official but if it takes shape into something solid then that would be a side effect to its current purpose.

The intention is to kick the project off using both [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [deno](https://deno.land/) while gradually transitioning the project completely to deno (scripts, tools, package handling etc).

The main use case for node at the moment is to publish the packages to npm and to utilise workspaces in yarn and npm while utilising a tool like [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) (only available on node).
